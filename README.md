# NextProject

The next project is a game application that requires a database to store and manage data. The application uses MongoDB Atlas as the remote database and implements CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to allow users to interact with the game data.

To ensure that only authorized users can access the application, it incorporates authentication mechanisms with GitHub and Facebook providers. This way, users can log in to the application using their GitHub or Facebook credentials.

Furthermore, the application implements routing guards to protect routes that require authorization, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive information.

Overall, this project aims to create a robust and secure game application that allows users to interact with game data through a remote database while ensuring user authentication and authorization.
